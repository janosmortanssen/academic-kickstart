The Smart Mobility Lab is a model-based platform for implementation and demonstration of intelligent solutions for safe and energy efficient road transport, giving researchers and students the opportunity to experiment and test new ideas long before they can be implemented in real vehicles and real traffic. The Smart Mobility Lab is based on radio-controlled autonomous model vehicles, an indoor wireless communication network, and a positioning system based on infra-red cameras; all integrated with simulation and visualization tools that give excellent possibilities for building up the envisioned ICT infrastructure and for staging complex traffic scenarios.

In particular we have developed a Small-Vehicles-for-Autonomy (SVEA) platform to serve as our scalable fleet of small connected vehicles. The SVEA platform is built to be small, convenient, and cheap, while still being able to handle the same information signals full-sized vehicles typically experience, from sensors like multi-channel lidars, stereo cameras, HD cameras, etc.
