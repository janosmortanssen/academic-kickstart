Jonas Mårtensson is associate professor with the Division of Decision and Control Systems at KTH. He received the MSc degree in vehicle engineering in 2002 and the PhD degree in automatic control 2007, both from KTH. He received the docent title in 2016.

Between 2008 and 2012 he worked on modeling, control and optmization of the transient torque response in combustion engines, utilizing variable geometry turbines and variable valve timings. During this time he was supervising the doctoral student Oscar Flärdh.

Since 2011 his main research is within cooperative and autonomous transports, in particular related to heavy-duty vehicle platooning. He is involved in several collaboration projects with Scania CV in Södertälje, dealing with collaborative adaptive cruise control, look-ahead platooning, route optimization and coordination for platooning, path planning and predictive control of autonomous heavy vehicles, and related topics. Within these projects he is supervising the doctoral students Manne Held, Goncalo Pereira, Alexander Johansson and Yuchao Li, and he is a co-supervisor or Pedro Lima, Valerio Turri, Mladen Cicic, Rui Oliveira and Joana Fonseca.

Jonas Mårtensson is a co-director of the Integrated Transport Research Lab and program leader for end-to-end freight transport. 

Jonas Mårtensson is co-director for the KTH Smart Mobility Lab.

Jonas Mårtensson is thematic leader for the area Transport in the Information Age within the KTH Transport Platform.
